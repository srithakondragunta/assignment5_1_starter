1. Age and Coupon Acceptance
- Younger drivers (under 30) are more likely to accept bar coupons. The frequency of bar visits tends to be higher among younger individuals, and as a result, they show a higher acceptance rate for bar coupons.
- Older drivers (30 and above) tend to show lower acceptance rates for bar coupons, possibly due to a reduced interest in bar-related activities.
2. Income and Coupon Acceptance
- Lower-income drivers are more likely to accept bar coupons. This suggests that passengers with fewer financial resources might be more incentivized by the potential savings from a bar coupon.
- Higher-income individuals are less likely to accept bar coupons, which may reflect less reliance on coupons.
3. Times Visited Bars and Coupon Acceptance
Drivers who visit bars more frequently (those who visit >3 times a month) are much more likely to accept bar coupons. These individuals are accustomed to bar visits, and the coupon provides an incentive for frequenting bars more often.
Conversely, those who visit bars less frequently (â‰¤3 times a month) show a lower acceptance rate for bar coupons.
